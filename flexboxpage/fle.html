                    <h2>Keep an Inventory</h2>
                    <p>It's important to keep a running inventory of what you actually have. There are many
                        sites that can help you keep track. I personally use the site <a href="https://backloggery.com/">Backloggery.</a>
                        The only drawback to it being that you have to enter every game manually. There are plenty
                        of alternative services out there though, so find the one that works best for you.

                    <h2>Proper Storage is Very Important</h2>
                    <p>Older games are <strong>fragile</strong>. NES games have pins that die very quickly,
                    CDs can be rendered unusable if they're worn down too much, and plastic can age if left
                    in poor conditions. Cartridges should always be in protectors, CDs should always be
                    kept in Jewel cases, and consoles should always be stored in a dry, dark place.</p>

                <h2>Always Check Before You Buy.</h2>
                <p>Games are, unfortunately, frequently faked. Spotting fakes is easy, if you know what to
                    look for. When buying cartridge games, especially Nintendo games, always bring either an 
                    example of a genuine cartridge, and/or a tool set to open up the game before you buy.
                    Fakes typically do not work properly. CD games should always be checked as well, as CDS 
                    are prone to scratching.
